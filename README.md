Abstract
Implement the following basic components of blockchain: 
(1) Transaction generation 
(2) Verifiable Merkle tree of transactions 
(3) Construction of blockchain 
(4) Integrity verification of transactions and blockchains.

This artifact contains code and datasets to reproduce the experiment results.

Software architecture:
Wallet Management: User_Wallet class for key pair generation and balance tracking
Transaction System: Creation, signing, and verification of value transfers
Block Processing: Block creation with headers and proof-of-work mining
Verification: Merkle tree implementation and integrity verification system
Txt file for data storage 

Reproducibility:
Running UI.java to test different components

Artifact Dependencies and Requirements

RAM: 4GB minimum (8GB recommended)
CPU: Any modern dual-core processor (2GHz+)
Storage: 1GB available space
Network: Basic internet connection for multi-user testing

Operating System: Windows 10/11, macOS 10.14+, Linux (Ubuntu 18.04+)
Java: JDK 8 (1.8) or newer
Dependencies: None (uses only standard Java libraries)
java.security (for MessageDigest, KeyPairGenerator)
java.nio (for file operations)
java.util (for collections)

Datesets are provided with the project (txt files)

Artifact Installation and Deployment 

Prerequisites

Install Java JDK 8 (1.8) or newer
Download from Oracle or use OpenJDK
Verify installation with java -version

Download
Clone or download the project files
git clone [repository-url] or download and extract the zip file

Time estimate: Installation takes 1-5 minutes, depending on Java installation status.

Running the Application
Clone the project in a Java environment and run UI.java 

The command-line interface will display options:
1: Create Account
2: Check Account Wallet
3: Transaction Generation
4: Verifiable Merkle Tree Of Transactions
5: Mining a Block
6: Integrity Verification
7: Exit

First-Time Setup:
Create at least two user wallets (option 1)
Generate transactions between users (option 3)
Verify transactions with the Merkle tree (option 4)
Mine a block to finalize transactions (option 5)

Time estimate: Deployment takes 3-5 minutes after compilation.

Reproducibility of Experiments

Workflow: List steps to reproduce experiments (e.g., "Run preprocess_data.py, then train_model.py").

Execution Time: 5-15 minutes

Expected Results:
